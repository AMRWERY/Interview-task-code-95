## Project Structure

### Components

- **navbar.vue**: Responsive navigation bar with logo, links, and search. Handles mobile menu toggling.
- **card-filter.vue**: Filter card for step-based (e.g., usage intensity, transport distance) or slider-based (e.g., load capacity) filtering. Emits changes to parent via v-model.
- **display-filters.vue**: Shows active filter tags. Users can remove tags to reset filters, which updates the store.
- **products-list.vue**: Displays a grid of product cards using data from the products store. Shows a skeleton loader (`product-cards-skeleton.vue`) while loading. Uses the `product-card.vue` component for each product.
- **product-card.vue**: Displays a single productâ€™s image, name, code, and capacity. Receives a `product` prop.
- **product-cards-skeleton.vue**: Skeleton placeholder for product cards during loading.

### Pages

- **index.vue**: Main page. Renders the title and divider, filter cards, active filters, and filtered product list. Uses refs and watchers to sync filter UI with the products store.

### Store

- **stores/productsStore.ts**: Pinia store managing product/filter data and filter state.
  - **State:** Holds products, filters, selected filter values, and loading/error states.
  - **Actions:**
    - `fetchProducts`: Loads products from a remote JSON endpoint.
    - `fetchFilters`: Loads filter options from a remote endpoint.
    - `updateSelectedFilter`: Updates a filter value in the state.
  - **Getters:**
    - `filteredProducts`: Returns products filtered by the selected filter values.

### Types

- **types/products.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for product, API response, and filter response data structures.

## Application Flow

1. On page load, the main page fetches products and filter options via the store.
2. Users interact with filter cards. Changes are synced to the store.
3. The store computes `filteredProducts` based on selected filters, and the product list updates automatically.
4. Active filters are shown as tags, which can be removed to reset filters. Skeleton cards are shown while loading.

All UI is styled with Tailwind CSS and is responsive.
